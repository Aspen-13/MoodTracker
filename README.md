# Mood Tracker (React + TypeScript)

A lightweight web app for tracking daily moods and reflections built with React + TypeScript.

**Live Demo** (https://mood-tracker-aspen13s-projects.vercel.app/)

## Motivation

I built this project to improve my React and TypeScript skills, focusing on state management and local persistence.  
It also serves as a simple, practical tool for daily reflection.

  <tr> 
    <td>*Calendar view with tracked moods*</td>
